# String Matching Algorithms

###   Finding the occurence of a string in a cluster of words is what needed in a lot of programs, whether related to data analysis, text searching, and so on. We can take the cluster of words as a text document containing many number of a strings and a specific word is given to be searched among the document. 

###  The string matching algorithms has a lot of applications in multiple areas. First, an adapted and efficient algorithms can help to enhance the responsiveness of text editing software. Other applications in Information Technology includes : 
* Web search engines,
* Spam filters,
* Natural language processing,
* Searching of particular pattern in DNA,
* Feature detection in images.

###   While applying a searching algorithm the two main elements that are taken care of are :
* **Text** - The string of text where the word is to be searched.
* **Pattern** - The word the needs to be looked over or searched for.
