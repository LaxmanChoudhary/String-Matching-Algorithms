# String Matching Algorithms

###   Finding the occurence of a string in a cluster of words is what needed in a lot of programs, whether related to data analysis, text searching, and so on. We can take the cluster of words as a text document containing many number of a strings and a specific word is given to be searched among the document.

###   While applying a searching algorithm the two main elements that are taken care of are :
* **Text** - The string of text where the word is to be searched.
* **Pattern** - The word the needs to be looked over or searched for.

### We will dive into number of string searching algrithms that can be used for string searching, each folder of the algorithms contains following part :
  * **Theory**
    * Description
    * Merits and Demerits
    * Analysis
  * **Program Implementation**
